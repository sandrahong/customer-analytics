# Overview

For this example project, I investigate short-run and long-run response to paid search advertising.

To get the results, I generated linear, concave logarithmic, and concave quadratic regression models and tested the significance of each model. Drawing on the fitted models, I computed the advertising elasticity implied by each model using Julyâ€™s monthly clicks and the saturation level for advertising spending. Results are reported in terms of daily advertising spending. 

# Data
