Short- and Long-run Paid Search Advertising Response 

In the exercise, the  retailer  uses 
different marketing strategies to drive traffic to its online shop. I've been tasked to 
give a recommendation on the performance of the retailerâ€™s search marketing strategy,

Adwords  that  includes  total  daily  visitors  to  the  shop  and  daily  spend  ($)  on  paid 
search. The dataset spans 66 days from May 1st 2019.
